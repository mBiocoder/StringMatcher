# StringMatcher
String matching algorithms and Benchmarking

This repository contains the implementation of following algorithms:
1. Naive string matching algorithm
2. Z-box algorithm
3. Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
4. Boyer-Moore with next table (BMN)
5. Boyer-Moore with bad character rule (BMB)

Additionally benchmarking is performed comparing the runtime (symbol comparisons) between two algorithms and plotting this using JavaFX.
